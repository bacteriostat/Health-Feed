# Health-Feed
This app provides latest news from the World Health Organisation using their RSS feed.

I made this app for a project submission to #30DaysOfKotlin and to demonstrate the modern android architecture designs that makes development fun and the app more fault tolerant.

This app pulls the RSS feed of WHO and displays it in a recycler view.

It uses some of the modern architecture designs, they are:

1) Data Binding
2) View Models
3) Live Data
